# Quantum Interface Watch - Web Application

## Overview

This is a Flask-based web application called "Quantum Interface Watch" created by Ervin Remus Radosavlevici. The application simulates a quantum interface monitoring system with a cyberpunk aesthetic, featuring status tracking, action logging, and digital signature generation. The system includes both a standalone Python class and a web interface with dynamic interactions.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript with Bootstrap 5.3.0
- **Design Pattern**: Single Page Application (SPA) with dynamic content updates
- **Styling**: Custom cyberpunk-themed CSS with quantum animations and particle effects
- **UI Components**: Bootstrap components enhanced with custom quantum styling
- **Icons**: Font Awesome 6.4.0 for iconography

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Flask (Python web framework)
- **Architecture Pattern**: Simple MVC-like structure with class-based logic
- **Core Class**: QuantumWatch class handling all business logic
- **API Endpoints**: RESTful endpoints for status updates, actions, and data retrieval
- **Authentication**: Basic root access system using SHA256 hashing

### Data Storage
- **Primary Storage**: In-memory storage using Python objects
- **Data Persistence**: No persistent database - all data is session-based
- **Logging**: In-memory action logging with timestamps

## Key Components

### Core Components
1. **QuantumWatch Class**: Main business logic handler
   - User management and ownership tracking
   - Status management (Idle, Activated, Build Completed)
   - Action logging with timestamps
   - Digital signature generation using SHA256

2. **Flask Web Server**: HTTP request handling
   - Template rendering
   - JSON API endpoints
   - Static file serving

3. **Web Interface**: Interactive frontend
   - Real-time status updates
   - Action buttons for interface control
   - Visual feedback and notifications
   - Particle animation system

### Authentication System
- **Root Access**: Hidden root key system based on email hash
- **Security**: SHA256 hashing for user identification
- **Access Control**: Email-based root access verification

## Data Flow

1. **User Interaction**: User interacts with web interface buttons
2. **AJAX Requests**: JavaScript sends requests to Flask endpoints
3. **Business Logic**: QuantumWatch class processes actions and updates state
4. **Response**: Flask returns JSON responses with updated data
5. **UI Updates**: JavaScript updates the interface with new information
6. **Logging**: All actions are logged with timestamps for audit trail

## External Dependencies

### Frontend Dependencies
- **Bootstrap 5.3.0**: UI framework and responsive design
- **Font Awesome 6.4.0**: Icon library for visual elements
- **Custom CSS**: Quantum-themed styling with animations

### Backend Dependencies
- **Flask**: Web framework for Python
- **hashlib**: SHA256 hashing for security
